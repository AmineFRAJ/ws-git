            <p>Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His presidency marked the end of decades of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa.</p>
            <p>Mandela's impact on the world was profound. He spent 27 years in prison for his fight against apartheid and emerged to lead South Africa through a remarkable transition. His dedication to peace, reconciliation, and social justice made him a global icon and earned him numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.</p>
